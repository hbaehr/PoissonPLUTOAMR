# PoissonPLUTOAMR

My attempt to make a module for solving the Poisson equation in an adaptive mesh (AMR) framework. This is a part of the PLUTO code, which through the Chombo libraries has functional AMR capabilities but has not yet incorporated self-gravity to the AMR part.

When it is all finished there will be instructions here on how to include this with the latest PLUTO version.
